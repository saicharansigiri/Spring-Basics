# spring-basics


Things I have learnt from this basic project
  - using Sping Initilizer to Quick  start Spring Projects.
  - concepts like Loose Coupling and Tight Coupling.
  - Stereotypes like @Component to initilize a singleton object and @Autowired for dependency injection and also basic use of @RestController and mapping 
  - using Application context to get objects 
  - using beans to access the Components or class 
  - and also one logging level debugging i.e logging.level.package=DEBUG to debug any package(application.properties)
